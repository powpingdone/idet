tldr Don't be an ideological ass.

I (powpingdone) do not endorse any user actions, even those who add code into the repository. If you're reading this, then the bottom line is that you are contributing to IdET and you have a specific interest in it as such. Share that common interest with other contributors/users, while accepting that they can and will be radically different. 

Strive to make better software, not to put users down under their differences. We can handle that, right? That being said, those who create implicitly political code edits such as "Changing master/slave terminology to be more inclusive" or "Use libfoo because libbar is built by communuists" will be closed on sight.

This is a public code repository, dammnit! Act like civil people when contributing, creating issues, and having discussions. Arguments in life ideology have no place here, on a obscure text editor repository.
